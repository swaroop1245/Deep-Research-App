    "\n",
    "The `WebSearchTool` lets an agent search the web.  \n",
    "The `FileSearchTool` allows retrieving information from your OpenAI Vector Stores.  \n",
    "The `ComputerTool` allows automating computer use tasks like taking screenshots and clicking.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is costing me 2.5 cents per call for OpenAI WebSearchTool. That can add up to $2-$3 for the next 2 labs. We'll use free and low cost Search tools with other platforms, so feel free to skip running this if the cost is a concern. Also student Christian W. pointed out that OpenAI can sometimes charge for multiple searches for a single call, so it could sometimes cost more than 2.5 cents per call.\n",
